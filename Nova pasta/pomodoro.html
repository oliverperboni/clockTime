        <h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros", the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.</p>

        <h2>How to use the Pomodoro Technique:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a task you want to work on.</li>
            <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro).</li>
            <li>Work on the task until the timer rings.</li>
            <li>Take a short break (around 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Repeat the process. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).</li>
        </ul>
